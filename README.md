# Project Showcase
This page contains examples and results from various projects I have worked on. All of the examples were completed from 2018 to now either as a class or research project at Augustana College, or they were completed through personal interest. In each folder you will find a README.md file that explains the project scope and file contents. Below are short descriptions of the projects included: 

1. **Bedrock Mapping GIS**: Manual identificaiton of bedrock units using ArcGIS Pro. Includes map, cross section, and explanation of rock units. 
2. **Big 5 Personality Analysis & Modeling**: Analysis of personalities from a Big 5 Personality dataset to predict a personality given answeres to survey questions. Analysis and modeling completed through Python notebooks. 
3. **Butterfly Analysis**: Analyzed butterfly populations over a  given timeframe. Employed Excel and R programming for all visualizations, computed statistics, and T-tests. 
4. **Earthquake Analysis & Modeling**: Gathered USGS data along San Andreas faultline to gain insight of earthquake intervals and occurence. Modeling and earthquake predition efforts done in Python notebooks. 
5. **Surficial Mapping GIS**: Manual identification of surficial deposits and erosion using LiDAR data in ArcGIS Pro. 
6. **Transaction Data Analysis & Modeling**: Data Analytics Senior Inquiry. Given a scrubbed transaction dataset for one account at Augustana College, an in depth analysis and data understanding was completed. Further, hand coded rules were employed to predict whether each transaction was normal or abnormal. All analysis and modeling completed in Ecel and Python scripts. 
7. **Benac Knickpoint Formation**: Reaseach project and paper completed in fulfillment of a Geology minor. 
8. **Benac et. al. Recent Trend in Software Development: Low-Code Solutions**: Published paper concerning the prevalence and increase of Low Code software development solutions. Presented at the Future Technoogies Conference in 2021.
