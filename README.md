# About Ryan Benac
I graduated from Augustana College in 2022 Magna Cum Laude with my Bachelor of Arts. I double majored in Data Anlaytics and Computer Science with a minor in Geology. Before college I worked various jobs in retail and customer service. Through college, I worked as a Computer Science Tutor and Geology Lab Proctor. I also worked for Sedona Technologies as an IT Helpdesk Intern. After graduation, I started with the US Army Corps of Engineers as a Computer Scientist in the Geotech branch. I continue to work there to this day. I excel at employing creative solutions to streamline tasks and pipelines, analyzing and mining datasets to gain insightful information, and creating tools that ease the jobs of others. Employing my geology background, I am also able to research and advise on various geotechnical engineering questions.

# Project Showcase
This page contains examples and results from various projects I have worked on. All of the examples were completed from 2018 to now either as a class or research project at Augustana College, or they were completed through personal interest. In each folder you will find a README.md file that explains the project scope and file contents. I continue to work on many similar projects for the US Army Corps of Engineers, and I will be happy to explain upon inquiry. Below are short descriptions of the projects included: 

1. **Bedrock & Surficial Mapping GIS**: Bedrock mapping includes manual identificaiton of bedrock units using ArcGIS Pro. Included are map, cross section, and explanation of rock units. Surficial mapping includes manual identification of surficial deposits and erosion using LiDAR data in ArcGIS Pro. 
2. **Big 5 Personality Analysis & Modeling**: Analysis of personalities from a Big 5 Personality dataset to predict a personality given answeres to survey questions. Analysis and modeling completed through Python notebooks and PowerBI. 
3. **Butterfly Analysis**: Analyzed butterfly populations over a  given timeframe. Employed Excel and R programming for all visualizations, computed statistics, and T-tests. 
4. **Earthquake Analysis & Modeling**: Gathered USGS data along San Andreas faultline to gain insight of earthquake intervals and occurence. Modeling and earthquake predition efforts done in Python notebooks. 
5. **Transaction Data Analysis & Modeling**: Data Analytics Senior Inquiry. Given a scrubbed transaction dataset for one account at Augustana College, an in depth analysis and data understanding was completed. Further, hand coded rules were employed to predict whether each transaction was normal or abnormal. All analysis and modeling completed in Excel, Tableau, and Python scripts. 
6. **Benac Knickpoint Formation**: Reaseach project and paper completed in fulfillment of a Geology minor. 
7. **Benac et. al. Recent Trend in Software Development: Low-Code Solutions**: Published paper concerning the prevalence and increase of Low Code software development solutions. Presented at the Future Technoogies Conference in 2021.
