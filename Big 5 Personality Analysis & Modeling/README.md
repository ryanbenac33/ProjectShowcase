# Big 5 Personality Analysis & Modeling
Completed: March 2022

Following a CRISP-DM process, our team followed a rough Python notebook outline to build a predictive model for personalities. The dataset consists of survey responses from a given online personality test, as well as information about test length and browser specs. A human then went through and assigned 1 of 5 personality types to that individual. After exploring the dataset and pulling various types of useful information, we focused on using survey answers to predict a personality type when given new survey answers. Using a variety of modeling techniques including logistic regression, decision tree classifiers, and a bayes classifier, we were able to create a model that predicted personalities with relatively high accuracy and precision. Take a look through the file above named "Team 1 Big-Five Factor Markers.ipynb" to examine the entire data analysis process.
