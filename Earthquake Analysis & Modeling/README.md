# Earthquake Analysis & Modeling
Completed: December 2021

Following a CRISP-DM process, our team created an earthquake analysis and prediction model from scratch. The dataset was pulled directly from the USGS online earthquake data store. Date along the San Andreas fault running through California from the last 20 years was pulled into a single dataset. After extensive exploratory analysis we discovered several trends in earthquakes by geographical location and tiing intervals. We chose to focus on predicting the time interval between earthquakes. Employing linear regression and K-nearest neighbor, we built a model and explained the possible future use of both the model and our informational exploratory data analysis.Take a look through the file above named "[Final Earthquake Data Project.ipynb](https://github.com/ryanbenac33/ProjectShowcase/blob/main/Earthquake%20Analysis%20%26%20Modeling/Final%20Earthquake%20Data%20Project.ipynb)" to examine the entire data analysis process.
